I am an undergraduate completing an MEng in Nuclear Engineering at the University of Birmingham. I am currently doing my masterâ€™s project with the Morris group which is focused on density functional tight binding, using DFTB+, and how useful it could be as a tool for optimising the use of density functional theory calculations. This is being done from a random structure searching perspective.
