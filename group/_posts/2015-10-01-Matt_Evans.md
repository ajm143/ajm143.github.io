My main research interest lies in the application of crystal structure prediction techniques to the characterisation of potential electrode materials for next-generation rechargable batteries. I work primarily on the development of methods and software tools to handle the large volume of relaxed structures generated by ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) and related high-throughput methods, with an emphasis on energy storage applications. I develop two open source Python packages, [matador](http://matador.science) and [ilustrado](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~me388/ilustrado). I am a member of the [EPSRC CDT for Computational Methods for Materials Science](http://www.csc.cam.ac.uk/academic/cdtcompmat) based in the Theory of Condensed Matter group.

Prior to joining the group, I completed an MPhys in Physics with Theoretical Physics at the University of Manchester. I wrote my MPhys thesis on the electronic structure of defects in graphene/h-BN superlattices under the supervision of [Prof Francisco Guinea](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5FPqkUgAAAAJ). As an undergraduate, I spent two summers developing software [vfmcpp](http://github.com/charmedXi/vfmcppar) to model the microscopic dynamics of vortices in superfluid helium supervised by [Dr Paul Walmsley](http://www.condmat.physics.manchester.ac.uk/researchthemes/quantumfluids/), and one summer working at the University of Nottingham in the group of [Prof Elena Besley](http://ebesley.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/ Prof Elena Besley) on nanotube-encapsulated buckyballs.
