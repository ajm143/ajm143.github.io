I am a [Senior Birmingham Fellow](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/excellence/fellows/index.aspx) in the [School of Metallurgy and Materials](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/index.aspx) at The [University of Birmigham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). I hold visiting positions at both the [Univeristy of Warwick](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk Univeristy of Warwick) and the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk).

My current interest is in applying the AIRSS method to a range of different materials science problems, focussing mainly on lithium-ion batteries. "Trial and error" plays a large part in the discovery of new materials. From the initial idea, the material must be synthesised and categorised before it can tested which is slow, difficult and expensive. High-throughput computation accelerates this process by suggesting then screening new materials, allowing us to ask "what if?" without the time and expense of manufacturing and categorizing samples. I model Li-ion batteries at the atomic level and try to uncover new materials to increase their capacity.

I use global search techniques such as ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) to predict the ground-state structure of materials. From the ground state we use theoretical spectroscopy techniques to compare our results to experiment. As a junior developer of the electronic structure code [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org) I develop tools for optics, electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and core-loss analysis through the [OptaDOS](http://www.optados.org) code. I use and modify CASTEP-NMR to calculate the chemical shielding of battery materials in collaboration with experimentalists.

I am currently looking for PhD and Masters project students.

## Background ##

My first degree was an M.Phys. (4 year) in Theoretical Physics at the University of York. My final year project was titled Vertex Corrections in Many-Body Perturbation Theory. I worked with Rex Godby's group.

I did a Ph.D. in the Theory of Condensed Matter group in the Cavendish laboratories at The University of Cambridge. I worked with the group of Richard Needs and Mike Towler using the Quantum Monte Carlo computer code CASINO on a project about BEC-BCS crossover in ultra-cold atomic systems.

In the final two years of my Ph.D. I began collaborating with Chris Pickard where I modified his AIRSS method to be suitable to discover point defects in semiconductors. Throughout this project I used the planewave DFT code CASTEP.

I then spent three years as a research associate with Prof. Chris Pickard's group in the Condensed Matter and Materials group of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London.

In 2012 I moved to the Cavendish laboratories at The University of Cambridge, as an independent Winton Fellow, then in 2017 I moved to Birmingham.

My full CV is available on request.
