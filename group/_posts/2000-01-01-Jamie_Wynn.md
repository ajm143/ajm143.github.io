Jamie was a PhD student in the EPSRC CDT for Computational Methods for Materials Science. His research focused on first principles crystal structure prediction, using AIRSS (Ab-Initio Random Structure Searching). AIRSS is a powerful and flexible technique that uses the power of density-functional theory to predict the ground state phases of materials, as well as their low-lying structural defects.

He used AIRSS to predict the defects that can form in bulk crystals, as well as using group-theoretical considerations to calculate their configurational entropy. By considering the combinatorics involved in inserting defects into a lattice, one can then construct the Helmholtz free energy and hence predict the defects' finite-temperature abundance by minimising it.

He then went on to develop an AIRSS method to predict structures which can form inside nanotubes.
