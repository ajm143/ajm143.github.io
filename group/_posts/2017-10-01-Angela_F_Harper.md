I am a PhD candidate in physics from the US. I completed my BS in Physics at Wake Forest University in the US, with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. In my undergraduate, I have had computational research experience with both bioinformatics and perovskite solar cell modelling. At Wake Forest, I have worked on transistors in an experimental lab, developing green technologies for transistor fabrication.

Within the Morris Group, I work on modelling metal-phosphide anode materials for Li-ion and *beyond* Li-ion batteries. These materials offer potential applications not only in Li-ion batteries, but also in catalytic reactions. I am using AIRSS to search for new materials and better understand those metal-phosphides already experimentally known.

I completed my MPhil with the Morris group as a Churchill Scholar, and am continuing the PhD in the Morris Group at TCM, as both a Winton and Gates Scholar.
