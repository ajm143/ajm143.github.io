MSMDG is an informal discussion group within the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences. We are interested in all aspects of materials modelling, and as such, define "material" as broadly as possible. We are both theorists and experimentalists and model materials at all length scales. 

MSMDG meets fortnightly at 3pm on a Thursday afternoon. We try to alternate between Met&Mat and Chemistry.

We have a low-volume mailing list for advertising our meetings and other relevant activities amongst ourselves. Please email Andrew a.j.morris.1@bham.ac.uk to join the list. 

All (including undergraduates) welcome.
