title: "PhD studentship in the Computational Modelling of Disorder"
---

***There are many places where the description of a material as a periodically repeating crystal is inaccurate, or downright wrong. We must go beyond this picture to understand real materials and their dynamical processes.***

A competitively funded 3-year UK/EU PhD student-ship is available in the group of Dr Andrew J. Morris who has recently relocated to the School of Metallurgy and Materials at the University of Birmingham.

The research group, currently comprising 6 graduate students with 3 post-doctoral fellows, uses first principles techniques to predict the structure and properties of materials using only computer simulation.

Disordered Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a fast-ion conductor. Such materials are important for carbon capture, oxygen looping, energy storage and catalysis.

Many important technologically relevant materials cannot be modelled as a periodic crystal structure. The models must also encompass the short- and long-range disorder in these materials in order to accurately predict their properties. For example, point defects can drastically change both the electronic properties of semiconductors and the physical properties of high-performance alloys. Beyond point defects, both site disorder and amorphicity play a role in lithium ion battery electrodes.



The crystal structures of new materials can be discovered using ab initio structure prediction techniques, such as AIRSS. Over the past several years the group has developed methods for the structure prediction of point defects in semiconductors, battery anodes and ceramics for nuclear waste encapsulation. In this project we will develop new techniques to deal with more disordered systems using high-throughput computation on ensembles of structures, giving us insight into such materials at finite temperature and paving the way to an understanding of ion transport. First principles spectroscopies such as EELS and NMR will be used to compare our predictions with experiment. We work closely with world-leading experimental groups to verify our predictions and aid further experiments. More details about the group may be found at: [www.andrewjmorris.org](www.andrewjmorris.org)

The project is anticipated to be a mix of code development, high-throughput computation and liaison with experimental collaborators.  There will be many opportunities for international travel. The precise project can be tailored somewhat to taste.

The candidate will have a 1st class Undergraduate or Masters degree (or equivalent) in Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science or related discipline. A strong background with programming (e.g. python, Fortran0X, C, C++), solid-state materials would be advantageous.
Applications must be made through the university's on-line application system[1]: please provide a cover letter summarising your research interests and suitability for the position; the contact details of two people able to provide a letter of reference; and a full curriculum vitae. Please also send a copy of your full application to Andrew Morris directly.
