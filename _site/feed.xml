&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt;: Hypergolic materials, capable of spontaneous ignition upon contact with an external oxidizer, are of critical importance as fuels and propellants in aerospace applications (e.g., rockets and spacecraft). Currently used hypergolic fuels are highly energetic, toxic, and carcinogenic hydrazine derivatives, inspiring the search for cleaner and safer hypergols. Here, we demonstrate the first strategy to design hypergolic behavior within a metal-organic framework (MOF) platform, by using simple “trigger” functionalities to unlock the latent and generally not recognized energetic properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, a popular class of MOFs. The herein presented six hypergolic MOFs, based on zinc, cobalt, and cadmium, illustrate a uniquely modular platform to develop hypergols free of highly energetic or carcinogenic components, in which varying the metal and linker components enables the modulation of ignition and combustion properties, resulting in excellent hypergolic response evident by ultrashort ignition delays as low as 2 ms.&lt;/p&gt;

Through electronic structure calculations, we show that these block units affect the behaviour of electrons within the material in a peculiar way.

Slightly reduced block-type niobium oxides are magnetic - and the magnetism arises from localised electrons in the block interior.

Without atomic bonding, the universe would be just be one large gas with nothing solid in it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text-book four types of atomic bonding are ionic (think table salt), covalent (silicon chips), metallic (steels, iron etc) and van der Waals (how geckos stick to the ceiling). However, there is a fifth kind of bonding, called a non-covalent directional interaction.  It is responsible for water’s unusual properties such as expanding on freezing (most liquids shrink) and having a high boiling point compared to other molecular liquids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We care about this fifth kind of bonding as it can stick molecules together into molecular crystals which have a wide variety of uses, for example, capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, detecting trace impurities and toxins, sensing biomolecules and a vast collection of pharmaceuticals.  It’s similar to molecular Lego – the more different ways we can stick bricks together, the more useful (and fun!) materials we can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The halogen elements such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine can form these fifth-kind bonds. Up until now they were thought to only bond to small, compact atoms like nitrogen or oxygen, limiting the ways molecular crystals could be assembled. In this international collaboration between UK, Canada and Croatia we show that we can make molecular crystals by bonding the halogen iodine to the much heavier phosphorus, arsenic and antimony atoms, some 2, 5 and 8 times more massive than oxygen respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research paves the way for many new molecular crystals with fantastic new properties.  We show, for example, colossal expansion in a crystals with I…Sb bonds on heating.&lt;/p&gt;
