			<p><em>Abstract</em>: The prediction of topological preferences and polymorph stability remains a challenge for the design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibiting a rich topological landscape, such as zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Here, we have used mechanochemical screening and calorimetry to test the ability of dispersion-corrected periodic density functional theory (DFT) to accurately survey the topological landscape, as well as quantitatively evaluate polymorph stability, for a previously not synthesized ZIF composition. Theoretical calculations were used to obtain an energy ranking and evaluate energy differences for a set of hypothetical, topologically-distinct structures of a fluorine-substituted ZIF. Calculations were then experimentally validated via mechanochemical...

			<p>The crystal structures of transition metal oxides often feature octhedral motifs — one transition metal atom surrounded by six oxygens. Phases of niobium oxides take interesting crystal structures in which the octahedra connect via their corners to form larger block-like units, and those, in turn, stack up and next to each other to form the crystal. Through electronic structure calculations, we show that these block units affect the behaviour of electrons within the material in a peculiar way. Localised and delocalised electronic states coexist within the blocks, but are spatially separated. The delocalised states are present at the boundaries between...

These compounds adopt the primitive cubic pcu topology and show strict cation order. Optical absorption measurements show these compounds have band gaps within the visible and near IR region, suggesting that they may be useful for photocat- alytic applications. We also show that Cr[Bi(SCN)6] can reversibly uptake water into its framework structure pointing towards the possibility of using these frameworks for host/guest chemistry.</p>

			<p>Indium oxide is a wide band gap semiconductor that provides the platform for most n-type transparent conductors. Optical absorption is dominated by a strong edge starting at the optical gap around 3.7 eV, but the material also exhibits a prominent absorption tail starting around 2.7 eV. We use first principles methods to show that this tail arises from interband transitions that are dipole forbidden at the static lattice level, but become dipole allowed via a dynamical symmetry breaking induced by nuclear motion. We also report the temperature dependence of the absorption onset, which exhibits a redshift with heating, driven by...

			<p>We describe the approach for modelling solid-state fluorescence spectra of organic crystalline materials, using the recent implementation of time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) within the plane-wave/pseudopotential code CASTEP. The method accuracy is evaluated on a series of organic cocrystals displaying a range of emission wavelengths. In all cases the calculated spectra are in good to excellent agreement with experiment. The ability to precisely model the emission spectra offers novel insight into the role of intermolecular interactions and crystal packing on solid-state luminescence of organic chromophores, allowing the possibility of in-silico design of organic luminescent materials.</p>

			<p>Nanostructuring, e.g., reduction of dimensionality in materials, offers a viable route toward regulation of materials electronic and hence functional properties. Here, we present the extreme case of nanostructuring, exploiting the capillarity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) for the synthesis of the smallest possible SnTe nanowires with cross sections as thin as a single atom column. We demonstrate that by choosing the appropriate diameter of a template SWCNT, we can manipulate the structure of the quasi-one-dimensional (1D) SnTe to design electronic behavior. From first principles, we predict the structural re-formations that SnTe undergoes in varying encapsulations and confront the prediction with...

			<p>“Seeing” individual atoms is a tricky business. At such tiny length scales illumination by individual packets of light, called photons, will not work. Their wavelength, around 500 nanometres, (about 150th of a human hair) is simply too large to resolve atomic scale features in materials. To see how nature works at the atomic scale, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) uses a shorter wavelength particle, the electron. However, in the life-sciences this technique has proved unsuitable. Many biological molecules are too delicate: imaging them in an electron beam is like imaging a Ming vase with an artillery barrage.</p>

			<p>The electrical conductivity of metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) quickly saturates with respect to bias voltage due to scattering from a large population of optical phonons. The decay of these dominant scatterers in pristine CNTs is too slow to offset an increased generation rate at high voltage bias. We demonstrate from first principles that encapsulation of one-dimensional atomic chains within a single-walled CNT can enhance the decay of “hot” phonons by providing additional channels for thermalization. Pacification of the phonon population growth reduces the electrical resistivity of metallic CNTs by 51% for an example system with encapsulated beryllium.</p> <p><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.121408">Full Article</a></p>...

The lack of insights into the structural dynamics induced by electrochemical conversion of MoS2 still hampers its implementation in high energy-density batteries.

In the solid state, the quinoid and zwitterionic forms give rise to red and yellow materials, respectively.

An explanation for the observed colors of the crystals is found using a combination of UV/Vis spectroscopy and plane‐wave DFT calculations. The role of cocrystal coformers in modifying crystal color is also established. Several new crystal structures are determined using a combination of X‐ray and electron diffraction,...

			<p>Phosphorus has received recent attention in the context of high-capacity and high-rate anodes for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries. Here, we present a first-principles structure prediction study combined with NMR calculations, which gives us insights into its lithiation/sodiation process. We report a variety of new phases found by the ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) and the atomic species swapping methods. Of particular interest, a stable Na5P4–C2/m structure and locally stable structures found less than 10 meV/f.u. from the convex hull such as Li4P3–P212121, NaP5–Pnma, and Na4P3–Cmcm. The mechanical stability of Na5P4–C2/m and Li4P3–P212121 has been studied by first-principles phonon calculations....

			<p>The collaboration between this Group and the Warwick NPCM group has a new <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/csc_old/collab/npcms/">website</a>. The global demand for smaller and more energy efficient devices has been sustained by a steady decrease in the scale on which silicon microelectronics can be manufactured. To continue this trend beyond the mid 2020s devices with dimensions of just 1-2nm will be required, likely using alternatives to silicon.</p>

			<p>Metallic germanium is a promising anode material in secondary lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity (1623 mAh/g) and low operating voltage, coupled with the high lithium-ion diffusivity and electronic conductivity of lithiated Ge. In contrast to previous work, which postulated the formation of Li9Ge4 upon initial lithiation, we show that crystalline Ge first reacts to form a mixture of amorphous and crystalline Li7Ge3 (space group P3212). Which we predicted to be stable in our recent theoretical study</p>
