<p>The group is advertising a one-year (in the first instance) postdoctoral position. This project focuses on developing new algorithms to determine structural similarity in crystalline materials, and for developing new in silico approaches to determining oxide ion conductivity in materials. For more information see [http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/10698/ here] or contact Dr Andrew Morris.</p>
