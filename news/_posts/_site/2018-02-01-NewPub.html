<p>Computational evaluation of metal pentazolate frameworks: inorganic analogues of azolate metal–organic frameworks</p>

<p>From superconductors to carbon-based life, a wealth of structural and electronic complexity is obtainable from just 92 atomic building blocks. The way that atoms are bonded together is heavily prescribed by their size and the strength of the electronic bond.</p>

<p>Imagine the wealth of new material properties if we could design our own building blocks each with their own interaction strengths, size and electronic properties.  Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a way to realise this. Predicting how these molecular building blocks will join together is still hard, but using density-functional theory, the Morris group (UoB) in collaboration with the experimental Friščić  group (McGill, Canada) have, surprisingly, predicted not just a new structure, but an entirely new topology of a metal-inorganic framework.</p>

<p>Stable pentazolate compounds have only very recently been synthesised, hence this paper demonstrates the wealth of new materials that are still to be discovered.   Using the simplest of data-mining we predict a new topology, that is, a new way to arrange matter in 3D space, which we named, arhangelskite (after the first author Mihails). It is already inspiring further work using our more complex techniques in a race to discover what other surprises are out there. In the 21st century, what else is left to name?</p>
