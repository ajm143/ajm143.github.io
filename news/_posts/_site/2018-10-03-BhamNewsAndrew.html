<p>“Scientists are developing the smallest possible one-dimensional (1D) materials called ‘extreme nanowires’. Less than a nanometre in diameter, they are 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. Now, an EPSRC-funded collaboration between the Universities of Birmingham and Warwick has reached the ultimate limit – making wires that are just one atom in diameter.”</p>
