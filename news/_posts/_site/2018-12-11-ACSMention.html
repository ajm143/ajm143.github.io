<p>In a December 2018 Virtual Issue of the ACS journal <em>Inorganic Chemistry</em> entitled “Emerging Investigators in Solid-State Inorganic Chemistry” the Morris group received recognition for their work on battery anode materials using <em>ab initio</em> random structure searching (AIRSS).  The journal highlighted the Morris group’s work on <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b04914">Li/Sn and Li/Sb systems</a>, which helped to identify the phases of these anode materials which form during battery cycling. Within the issue, young investigators and groups were mentioned who “…have started their independent laboratories in the past 5–8 years and published notable papers in the selected journals Inorganic Chemistry, Chemistry of Materials, and Journal of the American Chemical Society since 2016.”  As the group continues to search for better <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b01398">battery materials</a>, identify new phases of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b04183">helical phosphorus</a>, and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpca.8b03481">develop new methods for density-functional theory</a>, they continue to forge ahead in the field of solid-state inorganic chemistry.</p>
