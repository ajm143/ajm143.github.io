<p>The first CASTEP Users Meeting was held this week in Birmingham, and organised by Andrew and Phil Hasnip.  The meeting was a success, with speakers travelling from as far as Taiwan to attend the workshop.  At the meeting, one of the Morris group PhD students, Angela Harper, took home the first place poster prize for her work on “Electronic Structure and Properties of Transition Metal Phosphides”.  Featured in the image here is Bjoern Winkler from Goethe University, Frnakfurt, Germany, giving the first talk of the workshop on “Understanding phase transitions using CASTEP”.  Andrew, and the rest of the CASTEP community are looking forward to hosting more workshops such as this one in the coming years, to make this an annual occurance.  This is in addition to the CASTEP Workshop held each year in August for new users and CASTEP developers.</p>
