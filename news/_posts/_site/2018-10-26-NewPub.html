<p>We report the first examples of thiocyanate-based analogues of the cyanide Prussian blue com- pounds, MIII[Bi(SCN)6], M= Fe, Cr, Sc. These compounds adopt the primitive cubic pcu topology and show strict cation order. Optical absorption measurements show these compounds have band gaps within the visible and near IR region, suggesting that they may be useful for photocat- alytic applications. We also show that Cr[Bi(SCN)6] can reversibly uptake water into its framework structure pointing towards the possibility of using these frameworks for host/guest chemistry.</p>
