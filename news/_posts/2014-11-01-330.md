 The high theoretical gravimetric capacity of the Li-S battery system makes it an attractive candidate for numerous energy storage applications. In practice, cell performance is plagued by low practical capacity and poor cycling. In an effort to explore the mechanism of the discharge with the goal of better understanding performance, we examine the Li-S phase diagram using computational techniques and complement this with an in situ 7 Li NMR study of the cell during discharge. Ab Initio Structure Search and in Situ 7Li NMR Studies of Discharge Products in the Li-S Battery System
