“Seeing” individual atoms is a tricky business. At such tiny length scales illumination by individual packets of light, called photons, will not work. Their wavelength, around 500 nanometres, (about 150th of a human hair) is simply too large to resolve atomic scale features in materials. To see how nature works at the atomic scale, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) uses a shorter wavelength particle, the electron. However, in the life-sciences this technique has proved unsuitable. Many biological molecules are too delicate: imaging them in an electron beam is like imaging a Ming vase with an artillery barrage.
