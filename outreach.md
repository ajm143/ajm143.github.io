<h4>Teaching</h4>
I have a wide range of teaching experience from school to graduate level. <br>
Since 2012 I have supervised 3rd year students' literature review writing course. <br>
During Spring 2011 I taught Mathematical Methods II problem solving tutorials in the physics department at UCL, continuing from teaching Mathematical Methods I in autumn 2010. And taught Maths Methods again in the autumn of 2011. <br>
In 2009 I helped teach GCSE Physics in a secondary school in Cambridge. <br>
In 2007 and 2008, I taught first-year physics to small groups of students studying at the University of Cambridge.  <br>

During the summer term, I did two further presentations to [Chesterton Community College](http://chestertoncc.net/)'s science club -- the first covered Special Relativity, the second, Quantum Mechanics. 

In February [Mike Galtois](http://www.michaelgaultois.com/)  and I went to [Chesterton Community College](http://chestertoncc.net/) and did a demonstration called "Order from Chaos: Cooling off the noise" which we described as "Join Andrew and Mike on a journey of the strange and wonderful world of physics and chemistry outside your comfort zone. We live in a world mostly between 0°C and 30°C, but we'll show you how and why things can get very strange outside of this narrow window. During this exciting and interactive experience, you'll experience flowers that shatter like glass, ceramics that float in the air, and magnets that stop attracting. Explore strange new exotic states of matter, and see just how "cool" Science can be, at temperatures as low as -196°C!"

# Recent

In April 2015 I gave a presentation to the [Bolsover Amateur Radio Society](http://www.g4rsb.org.uk/)  about "Bayesian Inference: Making the best guess" then in May I visited the Science Club at [Chesterton Community College](http://chestertoncc.net/) , Cambridge and gave a presentation called "Physics: Modelling the World Around".

I contributed to the ''HillsfFest'' event at [Hills Road Sixth Form College](http://www.hillsroad.ac.uk/)  in June 2015, giving a presentation called ''The Chemistry and Physics of Planets, Stars and materials that matter.''

In Autumn 2012 I moved back to Cambridge and got involved making a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RzrfhIgyH4)  for [gamespot](http://www.gamespot.com/)  working with [Cam and Seb](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzL1QebGETNoRIOCu-GC0Ew) , highlighting quantum locking and how it might make the futuristic racing cars hover in the classic computer game [WipEout](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/) .

I've been involved with a number of outreach projects and am always looking for opportunities to engage the general public in my work, and with science in general. In 2007 and 2008 I was involved with [Physics at Work](http://outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/programme/physicsatwork)  a scheme run by the [Cavendish Laboratory](http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/)  in Cambridge to encourage 16 to 18 year olds to take science courses at university. I gave a number of talks to small groups. In 2010 I was involved with the [A Molecule's Eye View of Water exhibit](http://www.chem.ucl.ac.uk/ice/outreach.html)  at the [Royal Society's Summer Science Exhibition](http://sse.royalsociety.org)  at the [Southbank Centre](http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/) . I chatted to people about the properties of ice and water and presented some demonstrations of supercooled water and deuterium ice.

In March 2011 I was again involved with the [Molecule's Eye View of Water](http://www.chem.ucl.ac.uk/ice/outreach.html)  exhibition, this time at the [Big Bang Fair](https://www.thebigbangfair.co.uk/)  at the [Excel Centre](http://www.excel-london.co.uk/)  in London's Docklands. That summer I helped organise the [London Centre for Nanotechnology](https://www.london-nano.com/) 's Pilot "What we do at Work..." outreach event. We had 6 different exhibits and I demonstrated the A Molecule's Eye View of Water exhibit.

Not just for children: in April 2014 I gave a presentation to the [Bolsover Amateur Radio Society](http://www.g4rsb.org.uk/)  about "State of the art Lithium Ion Batteries".

# Schools

In 2010 I visited the Haberdasher's Aske's School for Girl's and gave a talk about my work entitled "Solving the Crystal Maze: The Secrets of Structure Talk"

![nuts]({{ site.url}}/images/nuts.png){:style="float: left;margin-right: 30px;margin-top: 7px;width: 250px;"}

I'm keen to speak to School Science clubs on a range of accessible topics such as :-

* 21st Century Materials: Why are materials important? What properties do they need? How do we go about making them.
* The Weird World of Quantum Mechanics: What was all that Schrödinger's Cat about? How can something be a wave and a particle at the same time?
* What's inside Jupiter?: And how do we know?
* Moving clocks tick slower: Special relativity -- how and why?
* The Reverse-Brazil nut effect: What happens when you shake a box of mixed nuts, a packet of cereal or pan for gold.
