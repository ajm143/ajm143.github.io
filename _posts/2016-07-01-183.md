 The group has won funding for a joint experimental and computational project with collaborators in chemistry (Prof Clare Grey, PI) and researchers at Imperial College and the University of Oxford, as well as industrial partners.

An excerpt from the grant proposal discusses the objective: "Overall, the project aims to provide new strategies to improve the performance of SSLBs but will also result in new electrolyte designs that are suitable for to protect Li metal in other so-called "beyond Li-ion" batteries such as Li-air and Li-S and smaller batteries for internet communications technologies."
