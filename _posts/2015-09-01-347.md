 Using software to predict the characteristics of materials before they're synthesised in order to guide and interpret experiments, the researchers successfully predicted the structures of a series of lithium silicides, an important step in understanding batteries made of silicon, and have also predicted new structures for a battery based on germanium. Thermodynamically stable lithium silicides and germanides from density-functional theory calculations
