Angela Harper won joint 3rd-place for her work on bringing the computational expertise of theoretical physicists using atomistic modelling methods and software developed within the CCP in Electronic Structure (CCP9), to not only experimental chemists, but to the wider community. This accelerates both discovery and identification of industrially relevant and new materials using computational methods, thereby reducing the costs, energy and time involved in conducting large-scale experimental studies.
