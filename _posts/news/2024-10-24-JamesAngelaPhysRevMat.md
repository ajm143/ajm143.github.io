In this paper, we used ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) to carry out a systematic search for crystalline Na-Ge materials at both 0 and 10 GPa. The high-throughput structural relaxations were accelerated using a machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) fit to density-functional theory (DFT) reference data, allowing 1.5 million structures to be relaxed. At ambient conditions we predict three new Zintl phases, Na<sub>3</sub>Ge<sub>2</sub>,Na<sub>2</sub>⁢Ge, and Na<sub>9</sub>Ge<sub>4</sub>, to be stable and a number of Ge-rich layered structures to lie in close proximity to the convex hull.
