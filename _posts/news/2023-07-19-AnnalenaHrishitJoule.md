Ni-rich lithium-ion cathode materials achieve both high voltages and capacities but are prone to structural instabilities and oxygen loss. The origin of the instability lies in the pronounced oxidation of O during delithiation: for LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, NiO<sub>2</sub>, and the rock salt NiO, density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations based on maximally localized Wannier functions yield a Ni charge state of ca. +2, with O varying between −2 (NiO), −1.5 (LiNiO2), and −1 (NiO2). Calculated X-ray spectroscopy Ni K and O K-edge spectra agree well with experimental spectra. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we observe loss of oxygen from the (012) surface of delithiated LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, two surface O⋅<sup>−</sup> radicals combining to form a peroxide ion, and the peroxide ion being oxidized to form O<sub>2</sub>, leaving behind two O vacancies and two O<sup>2−</sup> ions. Preferential release of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is dictated via the singlet ground state of the peroxide ion and spin conservation.
