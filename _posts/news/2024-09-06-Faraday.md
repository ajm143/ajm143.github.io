We welcomed 63 delegates to the University of Birmingham for a <a href="https://www.rsc.org/events/detail/76512/nmr-crystallography-faraday-discussion">Faraday discussion</a> on the latest techniques around NMR simulation. Lyndon Emsley was awarded the medal. Sharon Ashbrook delivered the concluding lecture to summarise the discussion. A good time was had by all.
