We welcomed 63 delegates to the University of Birmingham for a <a href="https://www.rsc.org/events/detail/76512/nmr-crystallography-faraday-discussion">Faraday discussion</a> on the latest techniques around NMR simulation. Lyndon Emsley was awarded the Spiers Memorial medal for his excellence in the field. Sharon Ashbrook delivered the concluding lecture to summarise the lively discussion over the three days. A good time was had by all.
