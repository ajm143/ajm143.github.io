 In this combined theory and experimental work published in Energy and Environmental science we show the dual behaviour of alumina coatings in protecting high-capacity Ni rich NMC cathodes for Li-ion batteries. A plethora of experimental techniques like solid state NMR, XAS, OEMS combined with DFT+U calculations show the chemical effect of Alumina in reducing the Ni-O hybridisation and hence preventing O loss as well as the physical barrier effect preventing ion scavenging by parasitic side reactions of electrolytes.
