In our latest computational investigation on battery materials using DFT+DMFT, we've shown that the redox mechanisms in the up-and-coming Li-rich Li<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>3</sub> differs from that of standard LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, with O dimerisation playing an important role in Li migration. This discovery is essential in designing better Li-rich high Ni-content cathodes.
