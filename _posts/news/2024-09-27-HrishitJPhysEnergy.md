In this JPhys:Energy publication we demonstrate that the origin of the experimentally observed paramagnetic insulating behaviour in experimentally determined room temperature rhombohedral structure of LiNiO2 cathode using DMFT calculations and successfully ascribe it to a strong correlation driven phenomena of mixed Mott-charge transfer character of ligand holes states without the need of unphysical symmetry breaking in the form of Jahn-Teller distortions to open a gap as is popularly postulated but not observed experimentally at room temp.
