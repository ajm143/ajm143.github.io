In this combined theory and experimental chem mater publication we show the efficacy of different DFT functionals based on their localisation in capturing the characteristics of O K edge XAS obtained experimentally for Li-ion battery cathodes. Our work focussing on the pre-edge and edge features show that hybridization, structural distortions, chemical composition, and magnetism significantly influence the spectra and are generally better described by semi-local functionals due to the non-local nature of O p orbitals.
