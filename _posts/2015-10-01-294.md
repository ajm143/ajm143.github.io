 Connie will be working on novel anode materials for lithium ion batteries. Prior to coming to Cambridge, she completed my BS in Physics at the California Institute of Technology in the US. Her research experience up to this point has been diverse including biochemical diagnostics, defence technologies, and iron-cathode lithium-ion batteries.
