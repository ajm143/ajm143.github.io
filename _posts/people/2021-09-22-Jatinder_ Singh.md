I am an M.Eng. Nuclear Engineering student at the University of Birmingham, currently I am doing my masters’ project with the Morris Group.

Within the Department of Metallurgy and Materials, I have done an internship to design a high-temperature tensile testing device. In my 3rd year, I have a done a group project to simulate the sigma phase in Fe-Cr alloys using MD. This project developed my interest in materials modelling especially in the application of Machine Learning to create new materials.
