I am a BEng Materials Science and Engineering student at the University of Birmingham and am interested in modelling materials. Currently, I am carrying out a summer internship in the Morris Group to help search for suitable cathode structures using AIRSS. I plan to continue to focus on modelling materials in my studies in the coming years of my study.
