I am a MPhil candidate in physics working on electronic structure prediction for novel battery electrodes.

Prior to coming to Cambridge, I completed my BS in Physics at the California Institute of Technology in the US. My research experience up to this point has been diverse and somewhat undirected, including biochemical diagnostics, defence technologies, and iron-cathode lithium-ion batteries. I am pleased to be joining the TCM group to explore the frontier of theoretical physics.
