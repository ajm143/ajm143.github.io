I was born and raised in Hubei, China. I received my BSc in Chemistry from Ocean University of China in 2019, and later that year, I started PhD in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry at Xiamen University under the supervision of Professor Jun Cheng. My doctoral research concentrated on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of catalytic processes under in situ and operando conditions. I completed my PhD in Chemistry in 2024. In the same year, I joined the Friščić group at the University of Birmingham as a Research Fellow, where my work focuses on the development and application of theoretical methods to evaluate potential energy landscapes of solid-state materials, exploring their structures and their potential roles in mechanochemical reactions to understand solids and their reactivity.
