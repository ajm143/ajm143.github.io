I am a [Senior Birmingham Fellow](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/excellence/fellows/index.aspx) in the [School of Metallurgy and Materials](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/index.aspx) at The [University of Birmigham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). I hold visiting positions at both the [Univeristy of Warwick](https://www.warwick.ac.uk) and the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk).

My current interest is in applying the AIRSS method to a range of different materials science problems, focussing mainly on lithium-ion batteries. "Trial and error" plays a large part in the discovery of new materials. From the initial idea, the material must be synthesised and categorised before it can tested which is slow, difficult and expensive. High-throughput computation accelerates this process by suggesting then screening new materials, allowing us to ask "what if?" without the time and expense of manufacturing and categorizing samples. I model Li-ion batteries at the atomic level and try to uncover new materials to increase their capacity.

I use global search techniques such as ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) to predict the ground-state structure of materials. From the ground state we use theoretical spectroscopy techniques to compare our results to experiment. As a junior developer of the electronic structure code [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org) I develop tools for optics, electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and core-loss analysis through the [OptaDOS](http://www.optados.org) code. I use and modify CASTEP-NMR to calculate the chemical shielding of battery materials in collaboration with experimentalists.

I am currently looking for PhD and Masters project students.

## Background ##

My first degree was an M.Phys. (4 year) in Theoretical Physics at the University of York. My final year project was titled Vertex Corrections in Many-Body Perturbation Theory. I worked with Rex Godby's group.

I did a Ph.D. in the Theory of Condensed Matter group in the Cavendish laboratories at The University of Cambridge. I worked with the group of Richard Needs and Mike Towler using the Quantum Monte Carlo computer code CASINO on a project about BEC-BCS crossover in ultra-cold atomic systems.

In the final two years of my Ph.D. I began collaborating with Chris Pickard where I modified his AIRSS method to be suitable to discover point defects in semiconductors. Throughout this project I used the planewave DFT code CASTEP.

I then spent three years as a research associate with Prof. Chris Pickard's group in the Condensed Matter and Materials group of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London.

In 2012 I moved to the Cavendish laboratories at The University of Cambridge, as an independent Winton Fellow, then in 2017 I moved to Birmingham.

My full CV is available on request.

My research group can take one or two students for the 2018/2019 cycle. We'd love to hear from motivated Met & Mat and Physics students. Please see some of the proposals listed on the <a href="../../research/index.html">research</a> page for project suggestions. Projects can be tailored to individual student's interests.

<h3><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Year Physics <br> <em>"A Quantum Approach to Solids"</em></strong></h3>

The course is split into three unequal parts. In the first part, we discuss how to model a solid using ideas from crystallography. Next we look at various models for vibrations in solids, where we can see how these models fare describing the  experimentally measured heat capacity. Finally, we discus the free electron and nearly-free electron model to understand the behaviour of metals, insulators and semiconductors.

See the <a href="https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/29009">canvas page</a> for more details.


<h3><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Year Materials <br> <em>"Frontiers of Materials Science"</em></strong></h3>

I am joint module co-ordinator of this course along with Biao Cai and David Collins. The course comprises a series of mini lecture courses on a variety of cutting edge research topics within Met & Mat.
<br><br>
As part of the course I present a mini-lecture course on <em>Materials Modelling the Next Generation of Lithium-Ion Batteries</em>.

<h3><strong>1st Year Materials <br> <em>Data Analysis</em></strong></h3>

The course is under construction. It will tentatively contain a discussion of basic data analysis techniques, with lots of examples of how data analysis can go wrong.

<h3><strong>1st Year Tutorials</strong></h3>

I tutor first year Nuclear Physics students.

<div style="float: center; text-align: center"><h2>University of Cambridge</h2></div>
<h3><strong>IA <br> <em>Physics</em></strong></h3>

I was supervisor for first year physics. The course contained Classical Mechanics, Introduction to Thermodynamics, Introduction to Quantum Physics, Special Relativity

One of the skills of solving problems in physics is to think on paper. The tidier you are, and the clearer your diagrams, the easier you will find it to answer problems. Make it easy for the marker to give you the marks. See my [Good Practice guide for solving problems](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~ajm255/good_practice.html).

<h3><strong>Graduate <br> <em>Electronic Structure Course</em></strong></h3>

In its broadest sense my research is all about how electrons behave in solids and what we can learn from this.  As such I frequently give lectures on Electronic Structure and the computer codes that we use to perform the calculations.

Here is an an example of using the DFT code CASTEP's NMR functionality from the very beginning [pdf](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~ajm255/NMR_example.pdf).
