I'm a visiting student from ETH Zurich studying material science. I write my master thesis here in TCM about electronic structure prediction for novel magnesium-ion cathode materials.

I wrote my bachelor thesis about the "Influence of different intermetallic phases on the aging and degradation behaviour of Mg-Zn-Ca" under the supervision of Prof. Peter J. Uggowitzer. During my master's I did a first research project with the title "Effect of epitaxial strain on cation and anion vacancy formation in MnO" under the supervision of Prof. Nicola A. Spaldin. My second research project was supervised by Prof. Laura Heyderman having the title "Investigation of short and long-range ordering in composite multiferroic films".
