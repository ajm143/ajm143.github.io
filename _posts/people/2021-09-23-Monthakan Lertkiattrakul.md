I’m an undergraduate materials science and engineering student at the university of Birmingham. Currently, I’m working with the Morris Group to carry out my final year project focusing on amorphous coatings for functional materials.

Previously, I did a year in computer science to improve my knowledge in computing as I’m interested in modelling materials to gain a better understanding of their structures and properties.
