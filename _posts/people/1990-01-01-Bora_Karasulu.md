Current Research: I am a PDRA in the TCM group, working in the modelling of next-generation solid-state lithium-ion batteries (SSLBs) project under supervision of Dr. Andrew J. Morris. My current research activities revolve around the prediction of novel solid Li-ion electrolytes to replace the conventional organic solutions with known potential health, safety and stability issues, using first-principles DFT methods along with stochastic structure prediction techniques.

In detail, possible compositions and bulk structures of novel Li-based electrolytes are predicted starting from the known electrolytes and using the group's PyAIRSS and MATADOR codes combined with CASTEP. Promising candidates with highest thermal stability are interfaced to known electrodes in an effort to address the reduced ionic conductivity across electrolyte/electrode interfaces. For that purpose, we have been developing an automated interface generation tool starting from predicted bulk structures. Besides, the ion-migration pathways inside the solid electrolyte framework are probed using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods, which is also useful for estimating the ionic conductivity of the candidate electrolyte. Apart from these, the electronic and spectroscopic properties of the potential electrolyte materials will be investigated using the group's OptaDOS code.

Background: I was awarded BSc and Msc degrees in chemistry and computational sciences (biochemistry) by [Koc University](https://science.ku.edu.tr/en/departments/chemistry/about/) (Istanbul, Turkey, 2004-2010). Afterwards, I did my PhD in computational/theoretical chemistry at the Max-Planck-Institute for Coal Research in the group of [Prof. Walter Thiel](https://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/theoretical-chemistry) (Germany, 2010-2014). My PhD thesis addressed a broad range of ground and excited-state, structural and dynamic properties of isolated flavin analogues as well as flavoproteins that regulate various biological processes. In particular, I elucidated the mechanisms of pertinent biocatalytic reactions (catalysed by flavoproteins) at a molecular level using (Gaussian-orbitals-based) quantum chemistry methods along with the combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM).

After the PhD, I have changed my research field from biochemistry to solid-state chemistry and worked as a PDRA in the [PMP group](https://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/applied-physics/research/research-groups/research-cluster-plasma-and-radiation/plasma-and-materials-processing-pmp/research-group/) of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) (Netherlands, 2014-2016, working with Dr. Ageeth A. Bol). My role at the experiment-oriented PMP group was to perform ab initio (plane-wave DFT) modelling of the surface chemistry underpinning the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of different metals and metal oxides on diverse 2D (e.g. graphene) and 3D (e.g. SiO2, ZnO, Al2O3, etc.) substrates. My aim was to provide fundamental atomistic understanding, used by experimentalists to improve the wafer-scale graphene-metal (oxide) integration, which is key for enabling graphene-based transistors, catalysts and other applications.
