I am a Winton Programme funded PhD student, currently working at the Theory of Condensed Matter group under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Morris. I am interested in studying materials properties using first-principles quantum mechanics simulations.

Structure prediction of Li-ion batteries electrodes. Lithium-ion batteries (LIB) are widely used in a variety of electronic devices. The next generation of LIBs will require anode materials with higher capacity than the currently used graphite, such as metal alloys of lithium. In this project I will be using a stochastic approach (AIRSS) to predict and suggest new materials with the desired physical properties.

Defects in simple oxides. Oxides play an important role in a wide range of technological fields. In this project we are applying the AIRSS method to find defects in simple oxides which still have not been found. The project is carried out in collaboration with Prof. Richard Needs.

Ab initio molecular dynamics study of liquid metals. I am interested in studying the structure of liquid metals from first-principles. In particular, how the electronic structure determines the short range order in the liquid. Previous work

During my M.Sc. thesis under the supervision of Prof. Guy Makov, I studied the short range order in liquid metals structure. While working with Prof. Makov I was also exposed to the fascinating field of computational physics.

As an undergraduate I worked with Prof. Amit Kohn on testing a methodology for imaging magnetic nanostructures in the TEM Lorentz mode.
