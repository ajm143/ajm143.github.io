I am a PDRA under the EPSRC Additional Skills Funding: Postdoctoral Pathways for Growth. My project extends my PhD work with the Morris group into the crystal structure prediction of 3D covalent-organic frameworks.

I completed my PhD under the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Topological Design at the University of Birmingham, where I combined machine-learned interatomic potentials and density-functional theory to develop design principles for magnetic metal-organic frameworks.

I did my MSc by Research in Physics at the University of Warwick, where I used DFT to calculate work functions and simulate surface reconstructions in III-V semiconductors. I finished my 5-year BSc degree in Applied Physics, with a specialization in Materials Physics, at the University of the Philippines Diliman. My undergraduate thesis focused on a DFT study of small molecule adsorption on graphene.
