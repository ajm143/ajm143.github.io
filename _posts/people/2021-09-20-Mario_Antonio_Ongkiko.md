I am a PhD student under the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Topological Design at the University of Birmingham starting in 2021. Current research interests are the intersections of topology, density functional theory (DFT), and machine learning.

I did my MSc by Research in Physics at the University of Warwick, where I completed my thesis on GaAs work functions and the structural relaxations of Sb ultra-thin films on unreconstructed InAs(111)B via DFT. I finished my 5-year BSc degree in Applied Physics, with a specialization in Materials Physics, at the University of the Philippines Diliman. My undergraduate thesis focused on a DFT study of small molecule adsorption on graphene.

Previous DFT work utilized Quantum ESPRESSO. However, current work in my PhD will shift towards using CASTEP for electronic structure calculations.
