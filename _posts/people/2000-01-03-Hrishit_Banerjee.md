I am a Post doctoral Research Associate at the University of Cambridge jointly supervised by Prof. Clare Grey (U. Cambridge) and Dr. Andrew J. Morris (U. Birmingham) (April 2021- ), with particular interest field of first principles calculations of correlated materials. I am funded by the Battery Degradation project of The Faraday Institute. I finished my PhD in June 2018, working on first principles electronic structure study of novel phenomena in complex materials. I then worked as a Research Fellow for the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) till March 2019. During my time at ICTP I was the PI of a CINECA Class C project I-2DFM, and worked on the emerging field of 2D ferromagnets. Thereafter I worked as a Post Doctoral Fellow at the Graz University of Technology (TU Graz, April 2019- March 2021), where I had experience of working on strongly correlated physics from the perspectives of Dynamical Mean Field Theory. My current research interests involve understanding from the perspectives of strong correlations, the physics involved in degradation of Li ion batteries.
