I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist working as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Physics at the University of Dundee in Scotland. I also hold Honorary Research Fellow position at the Morris Group, University of Birmingham, and Visiting Researcher position at the Grey Group, University of Cambridge. I finished my PhD in June 2018, working on first principles electronic structure study of novel phenomena in complex materials. I then worked as a TRIL Research Fellow for the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) till March 2019. During my time at ICTP I worked on the emerging field of 2D ferromagnets. Thereafter I worked as a Post Doctoral Fellow at the Graz University of Technology (TU Graz, April 2019- March 2021), where I had experience of working on strongly correlated physics from the perspectives of Dynamical Mean Field Theory. I  took up the position of Post doctoral Research Associate at the University of Cambridge jointly supervised by Prof. Clare Grey (U. Cambridge) and Prof. Andrew J. Morris (U. Birmingham) (April 2021- Jan 2024), with particular interest field of first principles calculations of energy materials. My current research interests involve understanding from the perspectives of strong correlations, the physics involved in degradation of Li/Na ion batteries, and hybrid perovskite solar cells.
