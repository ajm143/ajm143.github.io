I am a CDT student that completed the MPhil in Scientific Computing under the supervision of Dr Morris. During this year I worked on nano-phase change materials, and specifically silver selenide nanowires encapsulated within carbon nanotubes. I studied the different silver selenide configurations that can exist inside carbon nanotubes, as well as their electrical properties using the AIRSS method and the CASTEP code.

Background: I hold a diploma of Applied Sciences from NTUA with specialization in Theoretical & Computational Physics, and Materials Science. My diploma thesis concerned the development of code in FORTRAN90, simulating light absorption in a device consisting of an optical diode, which enhanced light trapping mechanism, and graphene as the absorbing material (Enhanced light absorption in graphene via a liquid-crystalline optical diode).
