I am a PhD student in the Morris Group working in the School of Metallurgy and Materials at The University of Birmingham. I carry out computational-based research on Metal Organic Frameworks using various approaches and tools, the main one being CASTEP, a density-functional theory package.

During my previous studies, I completed an integrated Master’s Degree at the University of York in Theoretical Physics. My Master’s dissertation project focused on atomistic spin dynamics simulations of magnetoresistive random access memory.
