I am a PhD student in the Morris Group working in the School of Metallurgy and Materials at The University of Birmingham. 

During my PhD I will carry out computational based research in the field of Material Science using various approaches and tools, the main one being the DFT package CASTEP. My current research focuses on Metal Organic Frameworks.

During my previous studies, I completed an integrated Master’s Degree at the University of York in Theoretical Physics. My Master’s dissertation project focused on atomistic spin dynamics simulations of magnetoresistive random access memory.
