I am a PhD student in the Morris Group working in the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/index.aspx">School of Metallurgy and Materials</a> at The <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx">University of Birmigham</a>. For the duration of my PhD I will be using the plane wave DFT package <a href="http://www.castep.org/">CASTEP</a> for the purposes of computational structure prediction of energy materials.

I completed my MChem at the The <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/">University of Reading</a>. At the end of my third year I was invited onto an EPSRC funded programme where I used <a href="http://libatoms.github.io/pymatnest/"> nested sampling </a> to calculate the <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/CP/C9CP00474B#!divAbstract">thermodynamics of small water clusters</a> under the supervision of Livia Bart&oacute;k-P&aacute;rtay. I later implemented nested sampling for my final year project titled "The validity of Embedded Atom and Modified Embedded Atom Models for describing the thermodynamics of bulk lithium".
