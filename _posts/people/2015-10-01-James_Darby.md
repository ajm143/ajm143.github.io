I am a Sims funded PhD student in the Morris Group, within Theory of Condensed Matter, Cambridge. My primary research interest is the application of symmetry to crystal structure prediction. My other research interest is matching electrodes to solid state electrolytes to ensure that a favorable interface is formed.

Before joining the Morris group I studied Natural Sciences, Physics, also in Cambridge.
