I am an undergraduate Natural Sciences student at University of Cambridge. Currently I am working with the Morris Group to carry out a summer project focusing on structures and transport properties of amorphous metal oxide coatings. My project is utilizing heavily on CASTEP and AIRSS and I am very interested in constructing computational models for battery cell materials.
