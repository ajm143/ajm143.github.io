Kamal was in the group as a PDRA at the University of Birmingham. His research focused on ab-initio structure prediction and theoretical spectroscopy to study carbon nanotube (CNT) encapsulated 1D crystals, with an emphasis on systems which undergo structural transitions in response to external stimuli. Thermodynamic and kinetic properties of these transitions will be computed to assess their utility for possible application in nano-mechanical/optical devices, and to identify associated spectroscopic signatures.

He recently completed his PhD under the supervision of Dr. Alessandro Mottura at the University of Birmingham, where he studied the effect of solute concentration on vacancy diffusion in Ni-based superalloys from ab-initio calculations. The focus was on the Ni-Re system, Re being an important element in superalloys metallurgy. I used cluster expansion to describe the energetics of the investigated system and performed kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to calculate diffusion coefficients. Prior to this, I did my Master of Engineering from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore where again my thesis was on the ab-initio calculation of lattice parameters in Ni-based superalloys and was supervised by Prof. Dipankar Banerjee.
