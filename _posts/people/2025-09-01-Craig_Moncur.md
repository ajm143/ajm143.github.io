I obtained my MSci in Theoretical Physics from the University of Birmingham, where my master’s project was focused on accelerating Raman calculations. In 2025, I continued my studies in Birmingham, with my PhD co-supervised by Professor Tomislav Friščić and Professor Andrew Morris. My research focuses on modelling the structure and reactions of materials, with an interest in metal-organic systems. In my spare time, I enjoy training as a decathlete, going to live music events, and spending time with friends.
