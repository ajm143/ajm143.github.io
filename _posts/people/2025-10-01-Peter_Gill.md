I obtained my MSci in Theoretical Physics from the University of Birmingham, where my master’s project was on spatial and generalised regularisation in Raman spectroscopy with specific focus on applications towards imaging pharmaceuticals. After completing my MSci, I stayed at the University of Birmingham to do a PhD under the supervision of Professor Andrew Morris. My research focuses on calculating NMR parameters of battery materials using a variety of first principles techniques. Outside of research, I enjoy climbing, which I do both competitively for the University, and for fun with my friends.
