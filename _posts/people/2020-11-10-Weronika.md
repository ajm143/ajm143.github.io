I am an MSci Natural Sciences student at the University of Birmingham with a double major in Physics and Computer Science. I am currently working in the Morris Group as a UKCP Summer Project student. The aim of my research is to improve the user experience within the group's software, ML-tools, and investigate the differences between machine learning potentials created by different neural networks, with a focus on materials relevant to battery cell modelling.
