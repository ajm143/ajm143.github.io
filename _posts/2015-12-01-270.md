 The centre will cover many aspects of fundamental physics, including advanced scientific computing, the theory of condensed matter, advanced materials and the physics of biology and medicine.   This will build upon the research from the Winton Programme and “will not be conventional research or ‘business as usual’, but a major effort to go beyond the boundaries of traditional physical science concepts”
