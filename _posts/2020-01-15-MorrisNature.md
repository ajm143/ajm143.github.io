The Nature Communications publication "Halogen-bonded cocrystallization with phosphorus, arsenic and antimony acceptors" [Full Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07957-6#Sec2) was featured in an article by Quebec Science on the "Formation of bonds between heavy molecules" [Full Article](https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quebecscience.qc.ca%2F14-17-ans%2Fencyclo%2Fformation-de-liaisons-entre-des-molecules-lourdes%2F).  This work on co-crystals with pnictogen-halogen bonds show that these bonds are strong enough to enable co-crystallisation, thereby paving the way for further research in this field.
