 Nathalie will be working on magnesium ion batteries. She wrote her bachelor thesis about the "Influence of different intermetallic phases on the aging and degradation behaviour of Mg-Zn-Ca" under the supervision of Prof. Peter J. Uggowitzer. During her master's she did a first research project with the title "Effect of epitaxial strain on cation and anion vacancy formation in MnO" under the supervision of Prof. Nicola A. Spaldin.
