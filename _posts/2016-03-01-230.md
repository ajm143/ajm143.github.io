 The collaboration between this Group and the Warwick NPCM group has a new [website](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/csc_old/collab/npcms/). The global demand for smaller and more energy efficient devices has been sustained by a steady decrease in the scale on which silicon microelectronics can be manufactured. To continue this trend beyond the mid 2020s devices with dimensions of just 1-2nm will be required, likely using alternatives to silicon.
